# Gesture Control RC Car

This was probably my first development project at college. The picture below was taken in 2018, when I demonstrated the final product for the embedded system course. Sadly I couldn't keep any video clips though, these resources occasionally remind me of the vitality and dynamic sway of the little thing came out from my hands. This is one of the proudest moments of my life, letting me feel the great joy of programming.

Some components could be out of production for now, or STM32 IDE does not support the program libraries for several drivers any longer.
